# CSV_Reader
A class designed to help parse a deliminated file or datasheet. 

By default, the delimiter is set to be ',' for csv (comma seperated value) files. Upon construction, you can set the delimiter to be anyhting you want. Commonly used delimtiers are tabs ('\t') and commas (',').

This class makes reading and writing to streams easy one liners and manipulating data seamless.
